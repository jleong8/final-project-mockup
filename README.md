## Landing Page

<p> This is the landing page to my page mockup. It currently looks fairly simple and I think in the future I should add more content to attract more users to visiting the site. </p>

## Add Activity

<p> This is the add activity page. It will have functionality that allows for users to add activities by checking off boxes that are applicable to the activity. This will help categorize the activities so that we can later sort the activities more quickly. We should be able to distinguish the type of activity and the location to better fit the user needs. </p>

## List Activity

<p> This page will list all activities available for users to visit. It should include pictures and descriptions of various places and hopefully we can later implement a way of sorting through the activities so that we can make it more applicable to the user's interest.
